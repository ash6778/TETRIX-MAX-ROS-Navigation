# TETRIX-MAX-ROS-Navigation

The robot model is used to navigate in the test environment and avoids an obstacle using the ROS Navigation Stack.


1) To visualize robot model in Gazebo and RViz in an empty map use:
      
      **roslaunch tetrix gazebo_full.launch**


2) To visualize robot model in Gazebo and RViz in the test environment use:
      
      **roslaunch tetrix gazebo_room.launch**


3) To map the environment using GMapping, in 2nd terminal use:
      
      **roslaunch tetrix tetrix_gmapping.launch** 
      and move robot using **rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py** 


4) To visualize pose guesses in RViz using AMCL use:
      
      **roslaunch tetrix tetrix_amcl.launch** 


5) To execute navigation use:

      **roslaunch tetrix tetrix_move_base_launcher_1.launch** 
      and use **2D NavGoal button in RViz** to set a goal position
